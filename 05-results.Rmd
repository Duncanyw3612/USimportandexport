# Analysis and  Results

## The development process of U.S. export data from 1999 to 2021

In this part, we want to analyse the development process of U.S. export data.\
Firstly, we want to see the trend of the U.S. export data on a general level, so we combine three data sets of overall export data of goods and exports to see such trend.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
g1_1<-Overall
