2. Analyze the data of import and export cooperation between the United States and different countries. Visualize the data to find out whether there are some similarities and differences between the cooperation.

3. Analyze U.S. export data to China. After the data wrangling and visualization, check if there exists changes in export structure before and after the Sino-U.S. trade war.

Also our work will focus on several parts shown below:

a. Basic data analysis and data wrangling, including multivariate data and time series data.

b. Basic data visualization, including barplot and boxplot to figure out relationships with and between multivariate data, and zigzag lines to demonstrate changing trend of time series data.

c. Advanced data visualization, including interactive relationship plots, geographic maps, interactive heatmaps and linear model analysis graphs.

d. Comparisons and summaries based on data analysis and exploratory data analysis.
