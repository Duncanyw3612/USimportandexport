Visualize the development of different industries to check whether does there exist developing trends. Analyze the data of import and export cooperation between the United States and different countries. Visualize the data to find out whether there are some similarities and differences between the cooperation. Analyze U.S. export data to China. After the data wrangling and visualization, check if there exists changes in export structure before and after the Sino-U.S. trade war. Also our work will focus on several parts shown below: Basic data analysis and data wrangling, including multivariate data and time series data. Basic data visualization, including barplot and boxplot to figure out relationships with and between multivariate data, and zigzag lines to demonstrate changing trend of time series data. Advanced data visualization, including interactive relationship plots, geographic maps, interactive heatmaps and linear model analysis graphs. Comparisons and summaries based on data analysis and exploratory data analysis.

Firstly, we want to see the trend of the U.S. export data on a general level, so we combine three data sets of overall export data of goods and exports to see such trend. From the picture we can see that data on exports in general have been on an upward trend in both services and goods, with the exception of a few few years. We speculate that the fall around 2001 and 2008 may be due to the global financial crisis, and the fall around 2020 may be due to the changes of trade policy towards China and the COVID-19.
