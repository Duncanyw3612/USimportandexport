Also our work will focus on several parts shown below: Basic data analysis and data wrangling, including multivariate data and time series data. Basic data visualization, including barplot and boxplot to figure out relationships with and between multivariate data, and zigzag lines to demonstrate changing trend of time series data. Advanced data visualization, including interactive relationship plots, geographic maps, interactive heatmaps and linear model analysis graphs. Comparisons and summaries based on data analysis and exploratory data analysis.
